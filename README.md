# Humble Superhero API - Full Project

This repository contains both the backend and frontend of the **Humble Superhero API**. The goal of the project is to build an API that allows adding superheroes with a humility score and displaying the superheroes ordered by that score. Additionally, a frontend built with React is included to interact with this API.

## Project Structure

- `humble-superhero-api/`: Backend of the API, built with **NestJS**.
- `humble-superhero-frontend/`: User interface built with **React** and **Vite**.

## IMPORTANT!!!

Each folder contains its own README.md.
